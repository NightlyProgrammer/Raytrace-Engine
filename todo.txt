placeholders in glsl code that are replaced before parsing shader
place holder declaration syntax idea:   #name#
currently all the place holders are repalced with constant values,later change those constants to uniforms that are passes to the programs so you can control values like the position of an object
add distance fog to the calculations of the reflaction
add refraction
add more primitives
add complexes 3d models aka mesh
with triangle intersect

add hud/2d menu on top by:
    drawing menu/hud to pygame surface
    reading surface data into texture
    passing texture as uniform sampler2D to the fragment shader
    in the fragment shader  
        -check if texture alpha is 0 /pixel is black aka pixel is transparent-
        mulitply texuter color with alpha and rendered color times(1-alpha) for transparency with textures
